Microsoft Windows SMBv3 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-0796) ScannersList

A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block 3.1.1 protocol handles certain requests. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on SMB server by sending a specially crafted packet to a targeted SMBv3 Server. To exploit the vulnerability against an SMB Client, an unauthenticated attacker would need to configure a malicious SMBv3 Server and convince a user to connect to it.
